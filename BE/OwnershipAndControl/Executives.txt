https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/OwnershipAndControl/Executives/BoardOfDirectors https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote For a public, for profit organization, its members (directors) are elected normally by the subscribers (stockholders) of the firm (generally at an annual general meeting) to govern the firm and look after the subscribers' interests. In the case of a not-for-profit organization, the board ensures the organization is acting in line with its mission. The board has the ultimate decision-making authority and, in general, is empowered to (1) set the company's policy, objectives, and overall direction, (2) adopt bylaws, (3) name members of the advisory, executive, finance, and other committees, (4) hire, monitor, evaluate, and fire the managing director and senior executives, (5) determine and pay the dividend, and (6) issue additional shares. Though all its members might not be engaged in the company's day-to-day operations, the entire board is held liable (under the doctrine of collective responsibility) for the consequences of the firm's policies, actions, and failures to act. Members of the board usually include senior-most executives (called inside directors or executive directors) as well as experts or respected persons chosen from the wider community (called outside directors or non-executive directors).

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/OwnershipAndControl/Executives/CorporateOfficer https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote In banking, corporate officers have the legal capacity to execute some documents and make certain decisions on behalf of the institution due to the nature of the business. The level of authority varies depending on the role the officer plays, however, and based on bank policy. In large institutions, corporate officers may include loan/lending officers, those in certain supervisory roles, and others with varying degrees of authority, and frequently they are given a 'vice president' title, particularly if they are customer facing. Hiring and other decisions related to such corporate officers may be delegated to more operational levels, rather than by the board directly, with respect to such personnel.
