The District did not have an elected local government until the passage of the 1973 Home Rule Act. The Act devolved certain Congressional powers to an elected mayor and the thirteen-member Council of the District of Columbia. However, Congress retains the right to review and overturn laws created by the council and intervene in local affairs. Jurisdiction is shared among numerous federal agencies, the attorney general for the District, and Congress today. Actions requiring litigation in court may be addressed in the District of Columbia Superior Court or Court of Appeals, or in Federal Court, depending on the issue.
