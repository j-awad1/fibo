https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/GovernmentEntities/NorthAmericanJurisdiction/CAGovernmentEntitiesAndJurisdictions/CanadianJurisdiction https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Canada's federal structure divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the ten provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons. Canada's three territories also have legislatures, but these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces. The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/GovernmentEntities/NorthAmericanJurisdiction/CAGovernmentEntitiesAndJurisdictions/GovernmentOfCanada https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II being the head of state. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. Its advanced economy is the eleventh largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks.
