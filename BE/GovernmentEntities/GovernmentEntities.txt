https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/GovernmentEntities/GovernmentEntities/GovernmentAgency https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote There is a notable variety of agency types. Although usage differs, a government agency is normally distinct both from a department or ministry, and other types of public body established by government. The functions of an agency are normally executive in character, since different types of organizations (such as commissions) are most often constituted in an advisory role; this distinction is often blurred in practice however.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/GovernmentEntities/GovernmentEntities/FederalGovernment https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote A federation is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions under a central (federal) government. In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, are typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/GovernmentEntities/GovernmentEntities/Government https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote In the Commonwealth of Nations, the word government is also used more narrowly to refer to the collective group of people that exercises executive authority in a state. This usage is analogous to what is called an 'administration' in American English. Furthermore, especially in American English, the concepts of the state and the government may be used synonymously to refer to the person or group of people exercising authority over a politically organized territory.

Many instrumentalities are private companies, and some are chartered directly by government. Instrumentalities are subject to a unique set of laws that shape their activities. Certain organizations, such as Sallie Mae in the United States, may be considered instrumentalities from some perspectives but not others. Sallie Mae's status was changed in 2004, when it was privatized, and since that time it is no longer considered a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE).
