https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/Partnerships/Partnerships/LimitedPartnership https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Limited partnerships are distinct from limited liability partnerships, in which all partners have limited liability. Similar to a general partnership, the general partners have management control, share the right to use partnership property, share the profits of the firm in predefined proportions, and have joint and several liability for the debts of the partnership.
