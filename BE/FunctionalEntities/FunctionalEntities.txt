Changes include deprecation of the SoleProprietorship class and making it equivalent to the class with the same name in the Sole Proprietorships ontology. This version also introduces a new FunctionalEntity class, as the parent of FunctionalBusinessEntity in this ontology and as the parent of Government in the GovernmentEntities ontology.
