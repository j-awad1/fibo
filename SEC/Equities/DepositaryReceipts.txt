https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Equities/DepositaryReceipts/UnsponsoredDepositaryReceipt https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote For an unsponsored ADR, a depositary entity can issue certificates when there's heavy demand from investors for ownership in a specific company from abroad. The issuing entity is normally a broker-dealer that owns common stock in the company. Because they're issued without the consent or cooperation of the foreign company, unsponsored ADRs generally trade over-the-counter (OTC)â€”rather than on a stock exchange. Also, shareholder benefits and voting rights may not be extended to the holders of these particular securities. Many large global corporations use unsponsored ADRs to attract American capital. For example, American investors can invest in Royal Mail PLC, a postal and delivery service company from the United Kingdom that was founded by Henry VIII. The company's unsponsored ADR trades OTC under the ticker symbol ROYMY.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Equities/DepositaryReceipts/AmericanDepositaryReceipt https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Most ADRs are issued by a domestic custodian bank when the underlying securities are deposited in a foreign depositary bank, usually by a broker who has purchased the securities in the open market local to the foreign company. An ADR can represent a fraction of a share, a single share, or multiple shares of a foreign security. The holder of an ADR has the right to obtain the underlying foreign security that the ADR represents, but investors usually find it more convenient to own the ADR. The price of an ADR generally tracks the price of the foreign security in its home market, adjusted for the ratio of ADRs to foreign company shares. In the case of companies domiciled in the United Kingdom, creation of ADRs attracts a 1.5 percent creation fee; this creation fee is different than stamp duty reserve tax charge by the UK government. Depositary banks have various responsibilities to ADR holders and to the issuing foreign company the ADR represents.

This provision makes the issuance of shares a private placement. Shares of companies registered under Rule 144-A are restricted stock and may only be issued to or traded by qualified institutional buyers (QIBs). U.S. public shareholders are generally not permitted to invest in these ADR programs, and most are held exclusively through the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, so there is often very little information on these companies.

the one where the original securities were issued, such as in a local market. Depositary receipts facilitate buying securities in foreign companies, because the securities do not have to leave the home country. They enable domestic investors to buy securities of foreign companies without the accompanying risks or inconveniences of cross-border and cross-currency transactions.
