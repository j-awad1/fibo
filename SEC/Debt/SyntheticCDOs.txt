If not, how to define the facts at the level of SPV without contradictions. Moving stuff off the balance sheet is involved in putting it into the SPV. So talking a bout balance sheet or off balanc sheet, this is about creating the pool which is going to be sold off. This applies whether hte pool is cash (real holdings) or synthetics. Either way ,the instruments are transferred into the CPV to sell them off. conclusion: applies to cash and non cash. In the old days there were all sorts of guarantees added to that SPOV. Now if you provide support to that =SPV it is no longer "Off balance sheet" froma regulatory point of view. Accounting rules refer.

Further Notes Review session notes 21 April: The first, second and so on, to stop paying out when there is a default. In each case you get the first, second etc. x% of defaults. Base underlying may be high or low quality. Create the pool by buying or selling protection depending on hich way you want to go, e..g. have high quality funds, (borrowers), would sell protection. If low quality, would buy protection to improve quality. So risk is no longer bound to the funding. REVIEW: More likely this is a band of percentages (from and to); review and formalize. See also note on attachment and detachment points.

Would be the actual contracts (the Ref Obligation contracts or the CDS contract)? Buyer of protection is buying protection and paying a fee. Similar to shorting on a stock. Seller of the protection is the one creating the instruments. So the Protection Seller is using the synthetic CDO as some kind of synthetic vehicle. Inside the portfolio is the actual contract that generates the cash.

A: There is funding to underpin the pool. The funding may be high grade debt or may be low grade. There is an undedrlying source of funds. then you swap (using CDS) into other risks. so I might lend to a government institution, and then sell protection against a whole series of corporates. So I've taken the high quality portfolio and added other risks to it. Or the other way round. conclusions:
