The certificate generally entitles the holder to receive a share, or participation, in the payments from a particular project. The payments are passed through the lessor to the certificate holders. The lessor typically assigns the lease and the payments to a trustee, which then distributes the payments to the certificate holders.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Debt/Bonds/ZeroCouponBond https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Fannie Mae also issues zero-coupon callable debt securities. Zero-coupon notes are debt securities on which no coupon interest is paid to the investor. Rather, the security is purchased at a discounted dollar price and matures at par. If the option on a callable zero-coupon security is exercised, it is redeemed at a higher dollar price than the original issue price. The yield for a callable zero-coupon security is based on the difference between the original discounted price and the principal payment at the call date.

Just as the owner of the stock receives a dividend payment as long as the stock is held, the perpetual bond owner receives an interest payment as long as the bond is held.

MTNs may be issued under a shelf registration program which allows the company to issue bonds over time with varying maturities and coupons. Companies issue MTNs to have a more flexible source of funding. They may also issue MTN in response to 'reverse inquiry' by investors looking for bonds with specific maturities, issue size and coupon.

The maturity's priority status under the call provisions means that it is likely to be redeemed in its entirety well before the stated maturity date.

Treasury bills are offered in multiples of $100 and in terms ranging from a few days to 52 weeks. Rather than providing interest payments as Treasury Bonds or Notes do, T-bills are sold at a discount, and the entire return is realized upon maturity. The price of a bill is determined at auction. The annualized interest rate earned on T-bills is equal to the difference between the purchase price and maturity value, divided by the maturity value.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Debt/Bonds/MunicipalSecurity https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote A municipal security is typically a bond, note, warrant, certificate or other similar obligation issued by a state or local government or their agencies or authorities (such as cities, towns, villages, counties or special districts or authorities). A prime feature of most municipal securities is that interest or other investment earnings on them are generally excluded from gross income of the bondholder for federal income tax purposes. Some municipal securities are subject to federal income tax, although the issuers or bondholders may receive other federal tax advantages for certain types of taxable municipal securities. Some examples include Build America Bonds, municipal fund securities and direct pay subsidy bonds.

If any bond so selected is redeemed, the Calculation Agent will select a new Fallback Bond on the same basis, but selected from all eligible bonds in issue at the time the original Fallback Bond is redeemed (including any bond for which the redeemed bond is exchanged). Note the rate of the fallback bond is used as a substitute for the inflation index if, for example, it is no longer published.
