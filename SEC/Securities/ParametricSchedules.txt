https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/ParametricSchedules/ParametricSchedule http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#editorialNote This is a schedule for one of the events that occur in a periodic schedule of interest accruals, interest payments, and (for floating rate swapstreams), changes to the interest rate. These may be specified individually but more commonly the Calculation event is the one scheduled according to this kind of parametric schedule, with the other dates specified as an offset to these. Here we have allowed for each of the related dates to be independently parametrically scheduled. The notional amount step schedule is a separate kind of schedule, with similar terms but without a period length. For calculation schedules (and possibly payments, resets), there is a different end date to the end /start of the period, since events may be specified as being on specific dates - this is where the Roll Convention comes in. This has the same basic concepts as the generic schedule shown as the parent to this. However, where the upper model has Date with various applicable sub types (known i.e. calendar, specified or determined). For example, an ISDA FpML schedule has a Specified Date (via a convention), and then has a date roll rule which is specified for the whole schedule and applies to each of the dates returned by the parametric specification of the schedule. It has: A schedule beginning and end; A set of regular repeating periods: the scheduled event takes place once per period; Optionally one or two stubs (one start and one end); these may be longer than the repeating period, or shorter. The precise parameters used are: Start of the overall Schedule period: Effective Date End of the overall Schedule period: Termination Date Start of first regular period: not specified (assume Effective Date?) Length of each regular period: Frequency (actually a duration) There are generally three ways in which the regular periods of a parametric schedule may be expressed: first plus last first plus period length last plus period length event date plus period length. In FpML, Roll events (the date that something rolls over from the value used in one period to the value used in the next) is defined in a Roll Convention, which may be a day of the month, a day of the week, or some published set of dates, typically the ISDA quarterly dates for these events. This is therefore the date within the regular period (before adjustments) when the event occurs. This is in addition so a date for the start or end of such a period. In general this applies to the Calculation Schedule (i.e. the event is the calculation event) with other dates specified relative to this, however in principle the other related events (payment and reset or refix) are specified relative to this. It is not immediately clear what specification of a date replaces the Roll event convention element when this happens.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/ParametricSchedules/InternationalMoneyMarketCanadianDollarTradingDateRule http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#editorialNote (continued within FpML definition): If the determined day is a bourse or bank holiday in Toronto or Montreal, the last trading day shall be the previous bank business day. Per Canadian Derivatives Exchange BAX contract specification. The above description implies a Date Roll Rule which is presumably referenced by referring to this rule, so that when this rule is referenced, there would be no Date Roll Rule defined in the FpML message. Semantically, this is still a Date Roll Rule, specifically a "Roll forward" rule with no modification (the third Wednesday of a month will never roll forward to a day in the following month so no Modified rule is required).
