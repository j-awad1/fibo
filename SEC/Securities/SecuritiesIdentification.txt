The ISIN is specified as a class of identifiers because although there is a scheme associated with the structure of an ISIN, there are many country-specific variations issued by national numbering agencies.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/SecuritiesIdentification/TickerSymbol https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Every listed security has at least one unique ticker symbol, facilitating the vast array of trade orders that flow through the financial markets every day. However, in some countries this relationship may be indirect, through the listing, rather than direct, as is the case in the United States. In the US, the relationship between a ticker symbol and the listed security is one-to-one. This is not, however, the case in Singapore, where there may be unique ticker symbols for the same security based on the lot size.
