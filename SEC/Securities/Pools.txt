https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/Pools/PoolConstituent https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The pool may be a pool of almost anything, brought together for some purpose. It differs from a less formal collection in that there are facts defined about the constituents and the proportions of these in the pool. Modeling note: A constituent of a pool may have facts which vary over time (such as balances) but the basic nature of the thing as a member of the pool remains the same, along with some facts which vary over time but which have a value as of the time they become members of the pool.
