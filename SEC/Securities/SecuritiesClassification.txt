https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/SecuritiesClassification/AssetClass https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Asset class means the broad category of goods, services or commodities, including any 'excluded commodity' as defined in CEA section 1a(19), with common characteristics underlying a swap. The asset classes include credit, equity, foreign exchange (excluding cross-currency), interest rate (including cross-currency), other commodity, and such other asset classes as may be determined by the Commission.
https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/SecuritiesClassification/AssetClass https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The three main asset classes are equities, or stocks; fixed income, or bonds; and cash equivalents, or money market instruments. Some investment professionals add real estate and commodities, and possibly other types of investments, to the asset class mix.
https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/SecuritiesClassification/FinancialInstrumentClassificationCode http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#definition classifier and code for a financial instrument defined in the ISO 10962 Classification of Financial Instruments (CFI) Code Scheme
https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/SecuritiesClassification/GlobalIndustryClassificationStandardsScheme https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The four tiers are: Sectors, Industry Groups, Industries and Sub-Industries. All definitions are standardized and applied to companies globally. Each company is assigned a single GICS classification in each of the four tiers, according to its principal business activity. Revenue is a key factor in determining a firm's principal business activity. MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indices developed this classification standard to provide investors with consistent and exhaustive industry definitions.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/SecuritiesClassification/ClassificationOfFinancialInstrumentsCodeScheme https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The ISO 10962 Securities and related financial instruments - Classification of financial instruments (CFI) code was developed as a solution to a number of challenges. One is to establish a series of codes which clearly classify financial instruments having similar features. The other is to develop a glossary of terms and provide common definitions which allow market participants to easily understand terminology being used.
