https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/LegalEntities/LegalPersons/SpecialPurposeVehicle https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) set up specifically to issue a security or securities. It is set up by a company or a group of companies for some purpose such as to create instruments that are off the company's balance sheet or to issue Participation Notes for investors in another jurisdiction. The SPV is formed for a specific reason and exists for a specific period of time and is then disbanded. Further notes: Special Purpose Vehicles are also referred to as bankruptcy remote entities, as they isolate financial risk. For Participation Notes: slightly different purpose but the same kind of vehicle. The only investment made by the SPV is that they buy in the stock. These are the same kind of entity in all of the contexts in which they exist.

Further Notes See definition in Inception Date for Fund. Separate fact exists here. Same definition used. EFAMA Review notes: Inception Date exists as soon as there is a prospectus, so it is a fact about a Share Class even if the share class is never formally issued or offered to the public. Legal structure exists even if something is not launched. Editor question: Review stated this was a fact about Share Class; confirm this fact does not apply to Bond and Note units, or was the term Share Class being used to mean all three? Meanwhile I have put the term "Issue Date" as a fact about all Fund Unit, as this is given a sa separate term in the EFAMA DD spreadsheet. MAy come clearer in the next version of that.
