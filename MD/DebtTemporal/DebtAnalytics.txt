https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/MD/DebtTemporal/DebtAnalytics/LoanPrepaymentFormula http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#editorialNote From SMER sessions: This is a model. Includes other factors such as homogeniety. To model this more completely we need to identify the parameters that go in to this formula. Among these is the above homogeneity measure - need to know how that is measured and in what terms it is expressed, e.g. as a percentage, with reference to some mean or standard deviation and so on. Also some of the parameters used in this model would presumably make reference to standard mathematical model constructs such as normal distribution, variaous deviation measures, Chi squared and so on. These are not presently in the semantics model, but can be modeled semantically if required. This would not however be a mathematical model - we only need to identify these and show meaningful relationships (not mathematical relationships) between them.

Detailed notes from Debt Pricing Review session 5 Aug: Identify what the spread is in relation to e.g. LIBOR. ALSO If fixed of floating. So if it's a FRN, For a fixed rate bond, it's priced off the on-the-run, e.g. a 30 year bond is priced as a spread wrt a 30 year treasury bond. So e..g spread would be something like 10bp+the value of the 30 year on the run Treasury. On the Run: definition needed. Also class of Thing and where this should go.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/MD/DebtTemporal/DebtAnalytics/SpanishYieldCalculationMethod http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#definition The method used in determining annual yield in Spanish corporate bonds.
https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/MD/DebtTemporal/DebtAnalytics/DebtConvexityAnalytic http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#definition The second derivative of a security's price with respect to its yield, divided by the security's price. A security exhibits positive convexity when its price rises more for a downward move in its yield than its price declines for an equal upward move in its yield. Further notes: A measure of the change in price for a given change in Modified Duration. This always (necessarily) refers to Modified Duration. This is used as another risk measurement. Numerator is always (a) duration - either MacCaulays or Modified. Always rate of change of (one of the) Duration against some other parameter. The other paramater can be characterised as a Yield (it may be the Price, but that has a relationship to the Yield in any case). REVIEW: Inconsistency in the above - is it always necessarily Modified Duration that is referred to, or "any" Duration measure (Macaulays and.or Modified)? notes 9 Dec A measure of the sensitivity of the price with reference to interest rates. This is normally determined with reference to maturity, but since there are different maturity dates, this figure gives an estimate of the equitvalent if you had a homogenous portfolio, i.e. this is an estimate based on a pure equivalent, homogenous portfolio. Convexity of instrument versus portfolio. Sees instrument in terms of the set of cashflows. The term Convexity can be applied either to a bond or to a portfolio. More notes: When you get Convexit in MD, it will tell you what Duration it is refrfering to, along with Redemption Date (logically). Also if there is Option Adjusted Yield, there is a third set of analytics. What are they? i.e. OA Convexity, Duration Yield and the rest. Conclusions: Agreed to revisit this in OTC.

Recall: every analytic formula relates to the set of cash flows, so there are assumptions underlying each of these, For example the assumption that Y is constant, which it isn't (because there is a curve, which may be convex not linear (is that right?). So you can compare rate or return between what I see and what the market has out there. In the US market: a Y which is calculated using Monto Carlo method simulation. relationship facts to add: Relation to method / formula (e.g. Monte Carlo), and the method used to determine the actual figure for the MC method. eff Y for single instrument: E Y for bonds without calls and stuff. Variation in this: whether we look at a whole set of bonds YTM quoted by Bmb would be the YTM quoted according to whatever the market is - = the NAtive Yield. SO: Publicly quoted more: choose another adjective.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Debt/PoolBackedSecurities/PrepaymentSpeed http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#editorialNote This is a model. Includes other factors such as homogeniety. Earlier notes: Same as Payment. Curtailment. Paydown is normally scheduled payments of the mortgage. Prepayment is when someone pays off the mortgage early I may send in 1500 when my monthly amount is 1000 a month. So the 500 is a prepayment. Scheduled principal payment. More notes 25 nov: Also factor in changes to the pool constituents where this is allowed for that kind of MBS. So we make estimates of how face value will will change. face value won't change but the underlying value of the Pf changes, so eg. the current mortgage factor. Model update note June 2010: Detailed types of "Prepayment Speed" analytic received from thomson Reuters, now modeled as sub types of this term. So term origin is PSA by extension, since this is the common super class of 3 specific prepayment speed analytic types defined by PSA. PSA stands for Public Securities Association. Type: PSA gives this as numeric, however definitions imply percentage, so defined as dated percentage for now. Many data models use numbers which are interpreted later as percentages so this may be the case here.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/MD/DebtTemporal/DebtAnalytics/ http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract This ontology covers an extensive range of analytical measures for debt instruments and pools of debt instruments. These cover the well-known concepts of convexity, duration and life, as well as weighted average loan ages and maturities, prepayments speeds etc. for debt pools. Most of the widely referenced variants of these are included, for example modified duration. Some yield related concepts (e.g. for equivalent yield) are also included. Debt pricing and yields are intimately related, and this ontology sets out the basic concepts of debt price, including different ways in which debt and bod prices are described and calculated, as well as a range of different kinds of yield (simple yield, Wall Street Yield, Japanese Yield and so on). The pricing terms are supported by a range of trading and exchange related concepts that are used to differentiate different kinds of debt price, for example last, high and low exchange prices.

Names are associated with algorithms. What yield you use to determining the present value. These are typically defined in a prospectus (for exchange traded) or Info Memorandum if it's traded in an OTC market. where it also defines the method itself. Action: look at some prospecti or get this from a vendor. Additional features 25 nov: Question - maybe Holiday calendar? Also date roll rules and roll back rules. These all apply. YC feeds in to Yield itself.
https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/MD/DebtTemporal/DebtAnalytics/BondEquivalentYield https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote For example when comparing Treasury with Corp it's called a Corp Bond Equivalent Yield; when comparing other kinds of yields this would be labelled differently. Treasury bills typically in discount rates - that's one of the ways you would compare TB or MM or RePo to BEQ - by changing the day count. Detailed implementation of this: This term refers to the type of bond that it is equivalent to, that is the type of bond whose yield is normally determined according to the yield calculation method that is used in determining this Bond Equivalent Yield figure. The type of bond in this instance is defined in relation to the market on which that bond trades, for example the US Corporate Bond Market.
