Conceptually, capital-labour productivity is not, in general, an accurate measure of technical change. It is, however, an indicator of an industry's capacity to contribute to economy-wide growth of income per unit of primary input. In practice, the measure reflects the combined effects of disembodied technical change, economies of scale, efficiency change, variations in capacity utilisation and measurement errors.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/EconomicIndicators/EconomicIndicators/Establishment https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The physical location of a certain economic activity - for example, a factory, mine, store, or office. An individual establishment is generally classified by having one NAICS code associated with it for statistical purposes, whereas an enterprise may be classified by multiple NAICS codes. The statistical structure is defined based on the operating structure and the accounting data produced by that entity. A given location may only need to publish revenues, whereas an operating unit (establishment) has employment statistics, etc. An establishment is defined as a producing unit at a single geographical location at which or from which economic activity is conducted and for which, at a minimum, employment data are available. In the case of a home-based business, the actual physical location would be specified as two distinct institutional units - as a household from a personal living and consumer perspective and as an establishment / operating unit due to the statistics required of the business.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/EconomicIndicators/EconomicIndicators/ProducerPriceIndex https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Statistical agencies implement the Laspeyres index by putting it into price-relative (price change from the base period) and revenue-share (from the base period) format. In this form, the Laspeyres index can be written as the sum of base-period revenue shares of the items in the index times their corresponding price relatives. Statistical agency practice has introduced some approximations to the theoretical Laspeyres target due to a number of practical problems with producing the Laspeyres index exactly. For these and other pragmatic reasons, some agencies use alternatives depending on circumstances. See the IMF publication cited for a full explanation of the most commonly used approaches and trade-offs made for determining PPI.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/EconomicIndicators/EconomicIndicators/GrossDomesticProduct https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Gross domestic product (GDP) is the value of the goods and services produced by the nation's economy less the value of the goods and services used up in production. GDP is also equal to the sum of personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, net exports of goods and services, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment. Conceptually, this measure can be arrived at by three separate means: as the sum of goods and services sold to final users, as the sum of income payments and other costs incurred in the production of goods and services, and as the sum of the value added at each stage of production. Although these three ways of measuring GDP are conceptually the same, their calculation may not result in identical estimates of GDP because of differences in data sources, timing, and estimation techniques.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/EconomicIndicators/EconomicIndicators/ProducerPriceIndex https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The standard methodology for a typical PPI is based on a Laspeyres price index with fixed quantities from an earlier base period. The construction of this index can be thought of in terms of selecting a basket of goods and services representative of base-period revenues, valuing this at base-period prices, and then repricing the same basket at current-period prices. The target PPI in this case is defined to be the ratio of these two revenues. Practicing statisticians use this methodology because it has at least three practical advantages. It is easily explained to the public, it can use often expensive and untimely weighting information from the date of the last (or an even earlier) survey or administrative source (rather than requiring sources of data for the current month), and it need not be revised if users accept the Laspeyres premise.
