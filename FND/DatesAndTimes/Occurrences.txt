https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/DatesAndTimes/Occurrences/ http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#changeNote This ontology was added to Foundations in advance of the December 2014 Long Beach meeting in support of the SEC specification. It is also needed to provide temporal relationships for Ownership and Control.

These three ontologies are designed for use together:

	* FinancialDates -- financial Dates and Schedules
	* BusinessDates -- business day adjustments
	* Occurrences -- occurrences (events) and kinds of occurrences

They are modularized this way to minimize the ontological committments that are imposed upon ontologies that rely upon them. Ontologies can import FinancialDates alone, or FinancialDates + BusinessDates, or FinancialDates + Occurrences, or all three together.
