https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Places/NorthAmerica/USPostalServiceAddresses/ZIPPlus4Code https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The correct format for a numeric ZIP+4 code is five digits, a hyphen, and four digits. The first five digits represent the 5-digit ZIP Code; the sixth and seventh digits (the first two after the hyphen) identify an area known as a sector; the eighth and ninth digits identify a smaller area known as a segment. Together, the final four digits identify geographic units such as a side of a street between intersections, both sides of a street between intersections, a building, a floor or group of floors in a building, a firm within a building, a span of boxes on a rural route, or a group of Post Office boxes to which a single USPS employee makes delivery.
