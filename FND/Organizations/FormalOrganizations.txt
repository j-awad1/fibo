	(2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
	(3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
	(4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
	(5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Organizations/FormalOrganizations/isEmployingParty http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#definition relates a party in the role of employer to the context of employment
https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Organizations/FormalOrganizations/Employment https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote In the broadest sense, employment is the situation in which someone is fully engaged in doing something that they want to do. From a FIBO perspective, however, employment is understood to be more specific. It is the relationship between two parties, evidenced by an implicit or explicit contract, in which work is compensated and in which one party, a legal person, typically a formal organization, acts as the employer and the other, typically a legally capable natural person, as the employee.
https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Organizations/FormalOrganizations/FormalOrganization http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#example Examples include a corporation, charity, government or church.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Organizations/FormalOrganizations/isDomiciledIn https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Corporate domicile refers to a place where a company's affairs are discharged. It is also typically the legal home of a corporation because the place is considered by law as the center of corporate affairs. In cases where a business has incorporated in one location for convenience, such as for taxation, legal, or regulatory purposes, but operates primarily in one or more other locations, domicile in FIBO refers to the operational location(s) rather than legal location. Many companies in the US have incorporated in the State of Delaware, for example, but do not have operational facilities in Delaware (or only have small offices there).
