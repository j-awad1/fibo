It may be fixed by a contract, left to be determined by an agreed upon formula at a future date, or discovered or negotiated during the course of dealings between the parties involved. In commerce, price is determined by what (1) a buyer is willing to pay, (2) a seller is willing to accept, and (3) the competition is allowing to be charged.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount/CurrencyIdentifier https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The first (left-most) two characters of the ISO 4217 3-letter currency identifier relate to the currency authority that issues the currency, and is, in most cases the ISO 3166-1 alpha 2 code for the geopolitical entity whose central bank is the issuer. The third (right-most) character of the identifier (alphabetic code) is an indicator derived from the name of the major currency unit or fund. If the currency is not associated with a single geographical entity as described in ISO 3166-1, typically a specially allocated identifier (alpha-2 code) is used to describe the currency authority. This code has been allocated by the Maintenance Agency from within the user-assigned range of codes XA to XZ specified in 8.1.3 of ISO 3166-1:2013. The character following X will be a mnemonic, where possible, derived from the name of the geographical area concerned.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount/hasMinorUnit http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#scopeNote Requirements sometimes arise for values to be expressed in terms of minor units of currency. When this occurs, it is necessary to know the decimal relationship that exists between the currency concerned and its minor unit. 
- 0 means that there is no minor unit for the currency; 
- 1, 2, and 3 signify a ratio of 10 to 1, 100 to 1 and 1000 to 1 respectively.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount/InterestRate https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Interest rates are typically noted on an annual basis, known as the annual percentage rate (APR). The assets borrowed could include cash, consumer goods, and large assets such as a vehicle or building. The rate is derived by dividing the amount of interest by the amount of principal borrowed. Interest rates are quoted on bills, notes, bonds, credit cards, and many kinds of consumer and business loans.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount/ http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract This ontology defines currency and monetary amount related concepts for use in defining other FIBO ontology elements. There are two distinct kinds of concepts that correspond to money and amounts: a concrete, actual amount of money, and the monetary measure of something denominated in some currency. These are dimensionally the same but whereas 'money amount' is defined as an amount of money, 'monetary amount' is an abstract monetary measure.

The definition of currency provided herein is compliant with the definitions given in ISO 4217. ISO 4217 provides universally applicable coded representations of names of currencies and funds, used internationally for financial transaction support. The ontology has been partitioned into 2 parts: (1) the essential concept system describing the standard (this module), and (2) ISO4217-1-CurrencyCodes, which contains all of the individuals specified in ISO 4217.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Accounting/CurrencyAmount/hasNotionalAmount https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The notional amount (or notional principal amount or notional value) on a financial instrument is typically the face amount used to calculate payments made on that instrument. This amount generally does not change and is thus referred to as notional.
		
		When applied to a swap this is the amount used for calculating the actual value of the interest due. Also known as notional value when describing derivative contracts in the options, futures, and currency markets, this term is often used to value the underlying asset in a derivatives trade. It can be the total value of a position, how much value a position controls, or an agreed-upon amount in a contract.

		An example is that a firm might have a variable rate loan on $100,000 but decide to swap only $40,000. The $40,000 is the notional amount of the swap and becomes the amount on which interest is paid.
