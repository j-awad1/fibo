A new currency code SLE/925 representing the new valuation (1,000 times old SLL/694) is introduced on 1st April 2022 for any internal needs during the redenomination process, and is replacing SLL as the official currency code, after the transition period to be determined. During this transition period, both the old Leone and new Leone will be in physical circulation for at least 90 days. The Bank of Sierra Leone will adopt the new code in the local system but SLL/694 shall remain in use until further notice. The Sierra Leonean currency shall continue to be the LEONE and this will not change after redenomination.

A new currency code SLE/925 representing the new valuation (1,000 times old SLL/694) is introduced on 1st April 2022 for any internal needs during the redenomination process, and is replacing SLL as the official currency code, after the transition period to be determined. During this transition period, both the old Leone and new Leone will be in physical circulation for at least 90 days. The Bank of Sierra Leone will adopt the new code in the local system but SLL/694 shall remain in use until further notice. The Sierra Leonean currency shall continue to be the LEONE and this will not change after redenomination.

A new currency code VED/926 representing the new valuation (1,000,000 times old VES/928) is introduced on 1 October 2021 for any internal needs during the redenomination process, but is not replacing VES as the official currency code. The Central Bank of Venezuela will not adopt the new codes in the local system, VES/928 remains in use. The actual currency code VES/928 remains the valid code after 1 October 2021 to use in any future transactions to indicate the redenominated Bolívar Soberano.
