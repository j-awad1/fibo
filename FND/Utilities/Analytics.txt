Notably, for skewed distributions, such as the distribution of income for which a few people's incomes are substantially greater than most people's, the arithmetic mean may not accord with one's notion of 'middle', and robust statistics, such as the median, may be a better description of central tendency.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/Analytics/GeometricMean https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The geometric mean is defined as the nth root of the product of n numbers. A geometric mean is often used when comparing different items - finding a single 'figure of merit' for these items - when each item has multiple properties that have different numeric ranges. For example, the geometric mean can give a meaningful 'average' to compare two companies which are each rated at 0 to 5 for their environmental sustainability, and are rated at 0 to 100 for their financial viability. If an arithmetic mean were used instead of a geometric mean, the financial viability is given more weight because its numeric range is larger - so a small percentage change in the financial rating (e.g. going from 80 to 90) makes a much larger difference in the arithmetic mean than a large percentage change in environmental sustainability (e.g. going from 2 to 5).
