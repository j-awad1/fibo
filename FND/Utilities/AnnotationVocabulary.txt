https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/ http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract This vocabulary provides a set of metadata annotations for use in describing FIBO ontology elements. The annotations extend properties defined in the OMG's Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary, in the Dublin Core Metadata Terms Vocabulary and in the W3C Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) Vocabulary, and have been customized to suit the FIBO specification development process. 

Note that any of the original properties provided in Dublin Core and SKOS can be used in addition to the terms provided herein. However, any Dublin Core terms that are not explicitly defined as OWL annotation properties in this ontology or in any of its imports must be so declared in the ontologies that use them.

	(1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
	(2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
	(3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
	(4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
	(5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations
