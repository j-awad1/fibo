https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership/Asset https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote An asset is something that provides probable future economic benefit obtained or controlled by some party as a result of past transactions or events. An asset has three essential characteristics: (a) it embodies a probable future benefit that involves a capacity, singly or in combination with other assets, to contribute directly or indirectly to future net cash inflows, (b) a party can obtain the benefit and control others' access to it, and (c) the transaction or other event giving rise to the party's right to or control of the benefit has already occurred.

	(1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
	(2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
	(3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
	(4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
	(5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.
