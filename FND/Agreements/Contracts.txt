https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Agreements/Contracts/ConditionPrecedent https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Condition precedents are common in wills and trusts. They include events or states of affairs that act as triggers for the contract to come into effect, such as a beneficiary reaching the age of maturity, or death of a trustor, as well as define obligations on a party to the contract, such as those required of a trustee on the death of a trustor.
https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Agreements/Contracts/Counterparty https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The counterparty is usually the party 'on the other side' of a contract from the perspective of the issuer or holder. The term 'counterparty' can refer to any party to an agreement, depending on context.

If the offeree acts on the offeror's promise, the offeror is legally obligated to fulfill the contract, but an offeree cannot be forced to act (or not act), because no return promise has been made to the offeror. After an offeree has performed, only one enforceable promise exists, that of the offeror.

		(2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
		(3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
		(4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
		(5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Agreements/Contracts/NovateableContract https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote In general, novation means consensual substitution of a party or obligation in the original contract with a new party or obligation in the successor contract. The new party takes on the rights and obligations of the original party. The corresponding novation agreement must be signed by the transferor, the transferee, and the counterparty (the other contracting party). Novation is frequently used in mergers and acquisitions to replace any outstanding relationships or rights and obligations of the organization being subsumed with relationships or obligations of the acquiring entity. It is also commonly used with respect to loan rescheduling.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Agreements/Contracts/isAssignable https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote An assignment (Latin cessio) is a term used with similar meanings in the law of contracts and in the law of real estate. In both instances, it encompasses the transfer of rights held by one party, the assignor, to another party, the assignee. The details of the assignment determines some additional rights and liabilities (or duties). Typically a third-party is involved in a contract with the assignor, and the contract is in effect transferred to the assignee.

Breach of contract is one of the most common causes of law suits for damages and/or court-ordered 'specific performance' of the contract. A breach of contract frequently invalidates the contract.
