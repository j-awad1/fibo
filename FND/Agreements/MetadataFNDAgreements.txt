https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Agreements/MetadataFNDAgreements/AgreementsModule http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract This module includes ontologies describing agreements between parties and contracts that formalize those agreements. These cover written and verbal contracts, including contracts which may be transferred from one party to another. The latter form the basis for financial securities contracts. The Contracts ontology also describes fundamental properties of contracts such as contractual terms, contract parties and so on, many of which form the basis for more specialized financial industry concepts such as interest payment terms, bond issuers and so on.
