	(1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
	(2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
	(3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
	(4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
	(5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations
	(6) to revise definitions using more formal sources.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Law/Jurisdiction/StatuteLaw https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote In the United States, statutes may also be called acts, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Federal laws must be passed by both houses of Congress, the House of Representative and the Senate, and then usually require approval from the president before they can take effect.
