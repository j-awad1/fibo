https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Law/LegalCore/ http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#changeNote The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Law/LegalCore.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
	(1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
	(2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
	(3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
	(4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
	(5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.
	(6) to revise some of the text definitions using more formal sources.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Law/LegalCore/Law https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Law is a term which does not have a universally accepted definition. Certain laws are made by governments, specifically by their legislatures although the sense intended here is broader. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution (written or unwritten) and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics and society in countless ways and serves as a social mediator of relations between people.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Law/LegalCore/ http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#changeNote The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20141101/Law/LegalCore.rdf version of the ontology was was modified per the FIBO 2.0 RFC.
https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Law/LegalCore/ http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract This ontology defines high-level legal concepts for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These concepts include law and constitution, both of which are framed at a more abstract level than national or state laws and constitutions, so that law forms the basis both for statutes and for company by-laws, and constitution forms the basis both for national or state constitutions and for instruments which are constitutive of incorporated legal entities. This ontology also defines some of the variants of these such as governmental constitutions and ordinances. Court of Law is also defined here.
