They also include commercial classification schemes, such as the Global Industry Standard Classification (GICS) developed jointly by Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) and Standard and Poor's, and competing schemes including the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) system, maintained by Dow Jones and London's FTSE Group, among others.
