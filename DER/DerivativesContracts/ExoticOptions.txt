The payoff of a call and put are given as: Rainbow-Call = max[0, max(S1, S2) - X] Rainbow-Put = max[0, X - max(S1, S2)] Minimum of n Assets. The counterpart to a maximum of n assets, this rainbow pays out the value of the underperformer of the n assets. The payoff for minimum of 2 asset rainbow calls and puts are given as: Rainbow-Call = max[0, mainS1, S2) - X] Rainbow-Put = max[0, X - min(S1, S2)]

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions/MountainRangeOption https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The price of a mountain range option is based on multiple variables, the most important of which are the correlations between the individual securities in the basket. Some options have discrete payout levels, such as double the investment or triple the investment, if certain performance metrics are hit by the underlying securities while the option is in effect. Mountain range options cannot be priced with standard closed-form approaches. These exotic instruments instead require Monte Carlo simulation methods. Effects such as volatility skew, which is found in most options, can be even more pronounced within mountain range options.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions/LowExercisePriceOption https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote LEPOs function as deep-in-the-money options similar to the stock itself. Both buyer and seller of a LEPO operate on margin. LEPO options are not available on any U.S. exchanges. Since the strike price is so close to zero, the investor purchasing the LEPO gains most of the features of owning the share directly with the major exceptions of dividends and voting rights. They are only available with European style expirations.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions/CommodoreOption http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#example A three-year commodore option with annual barriers would have three potential payoffs. The first would pay at the end of the first year and would be dependent on the pre-determined barrier being reached or exceeded. For example, if the underlying or basket of underlyings reached or exceeded 102% of its initial level at the end of year one, a coupon of 6% would be paid. At the end of year two, if the underlying reached or exceeded 104% of its initial level, another 6% coupon would be paid. The coupon in the final year would be 6% if the underlying reached or exceeded 106%. The coupon should exceed the performance level of the underlying, otherwise the investor would achieve the same result by investing directly in the underlying.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions/CliquetOption https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote A cliquet is a series of forward start options, all related to each other. Each forward start option represents the advance purchase of a put, or call, option with an at-the-money (ATM) strike price to be determined at a later date, typically when the option becomes active. A forward start option becomes active at a specified date in the future. The premium is paid in advance, while the time to expiration and the underlying security are established at the time the forward start option is purchased. If at the first settlement date the underlying security trades below the strike price of the option (for a call), then it expires worthless and resets to the price of the underlying security at the time of settlement. If at the end of the next settlement the underlying security trades above the new strike, the holder may elect to receive the difference between the market price of the underlying security and the strike price. Alternatively, the holder can let it ride to receive the sum of all payouts at maturity. The main advantage of initiating a cliquet is, if an investor expects volatility to rise, they can lock in their profits at predetermined levels and thus maximize their overall portfolio return.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions/RainbowOption https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Rainbbow options can speculate on the best performer in the group or minimum performances of all the underlying assets at one time. Each underlying may be called a color so the sum of all of these factors makes up a rainbow. These structures can be rather exotic and made for institutional clients when referring to financial assets. Rainbow options can be structured in many ways depending on how the performances of each underlying asset are considered. Some pay off based on the best or worst performance among the underlying assets. In other words, it looks at the top or bottom performance and pays off based on that single asset. These are sometimes called 'best of' or 'worst of' rainbow options.
https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions/RainbowOption https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Rainbow options are usually calls or puts on the best or worst of n underlying assets. Like a basket option, which is written on a group of assets and pays out on a weighted-average gain on the basket as a whole, a rainbow option also considers a group of assets, but usually pays out on the level of one of them. A simple example is a call rainbow option written on FTSE 100, Nikkei and S&P 500 which will pay out the difference between the strike price and the level of the index that has risen by the largest amount of the three.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions/AsianOption https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote These options allow the buyer to purchase (or sell) the underlying asset at the average price instead of the spot price. There are various ways to interpret the word 'average,' and that needs to be specified in the options contract. Typically, the average price is a geometric or arithmetic average of the price of the underlying asset at discreet intervals, which are also specified in the options contract. Because of the averaging feature, Asian options reduce the volatility inherent in the option; therefore, Asian options are typically cheaper than European or American options. They are used by traders who are exposed to the underlying asset over some time, such as consumers and suppliers of commodities, etc.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions/BarrierOption https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote A barrier option can be a knock-out, meaning it expires worthless if the underlying exceeds a certain price, limiting profits for the holder and limiting losses for the writer. It can also be a knock-in, meaning it has no value until the underlying reaches a certain price. Barrier options can be puts or calls. Barrier options typically have cheaper premiums than traditional vanilla options, primarily because the barrier increases the chances of the option expiring worthless. A trader may choose the cheaper (relative to a comparable vanilla) barrier option if they feel it is quite likely the underlying will hit the barrier.

The trader purchases 10 ABC Index options at a strike price of 2,800 options for $40 per contract. If the ABC Index closes above 2,800 at the end of the trading day on June 4, the investor is paid $100 per contract, which is a profit of $60 per contract or $600 (($100 - $40) x 10 contracts). However, if the ABC Index closes below 2,800 on June 4. The investor loses all of the premium amount or $400 ($40 x 10 contracts).

Sellers of lookback options would price the option at or near the widest expected distance of price differential based on past volatility and demand for the options. The cost to purchase this option would be taken up front. The settlement will equate to the profits they could have made from buying or selling the underlying asset. If the settlement was greater than the initial cost of the option, then the option buyer would have profit at settlement, otherwise loss.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions/LookbackOption https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote As a type of exotic option, the lookback allows the user to 'look back,' or review, the prices of an underlying asset over the lifespan of the option after it has been purchased. The holder may then exercise the option based on the most beneficial price of the underlying asset. The holder can take advantage of the widest differential between the strike price and the price of the underlying asset. Lookback options do not trade on major exchanges. Instead, they are unlisted and trade over-the-counter (OTC). This type of option reduces uncertainties associated with the timing of market entry and reduces the chances the option will expire worthlessly. Lookback options are expensive to execute, so these advantages come at a cost.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions/ForwardStartOption https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Forward start options typically attempt to keep future strike prices at the money or near the money. In this way, the holder will have the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) the underlying asset in the future at or near the then-current market price. Knowing where the strike price will be in relation to the underlying's price makes it easier to come up with the premium (cost) of the option, which is also typically determined and paid at the initiation of the contract prior to the activation date. If, at the expiration date, the underlying trades below the strike price of the option (for a call), then it expires worthless. If the underlying is above the strike (for a call), then the holder exercises it and owns the underlying at the strike price. For a put option, if the underlying is below the strike price, the option has value and will be sold or exercised to realize a gain. If the underlying is above the strike price, the option will expire worthless. Typically, as with most options, the holder may sell the option if it is in the money and take the cash instead of exercising the option. Since it is an exotic option, the seller and buyer of the option may also agree to settle the option with cash instead of delivering the underlying. Once a forward start option becomes active (strike price is set), then the option is valued like a vanilla option.

The difference between a knock-in and knock-out option is that a knock-in option comes into existence only when the underlying security reaches a barrier, while a knock-out option ceases to exist when the underlying security reaches a barrier.

They can look at current six-month options (January to June) and assess volatility to determine a premium for the option. They agree to trade one contract, equivalent to 100 shares of the underlying stock. They decide on a premium of $40, or $4,000 for the contract ($40 x 100 shares). The call buyer agrees to pay the $4,000 now (September), even though the option doesn't activate till January. On January 1, assume the stock price is $400. The strike is set at $400, and an option is now a vanilla option with a June expiry. At the June expiry, assume XYZ is trading at $420. In this case, the option is worth $20 ($420 - $400 strike). If they settle in cash, the buyer receives $2,000, or if they exercise, they receive 100 shares at $400 and can keep them, or sell them at $420 to make $2,000. Notice that this still results in a loss for the buyer, since they paid $4,000 but are only receiving back $2,000. To make money on the call, the price of the underlying needs to move above the strike price plus the premium. Therefore, if the price moves up to $450 by expiration, the option is worth $50 ($450 - $400 strike), and the buyer receives $5,000. That's a net profit of $1,000 over their $4,000 cost. If the underlying is trading below the $400 strike at expiry, the call option expires worthless and the buyer's premium is lost ($4,000 profit to the seller).

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions/ChooserOption https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote A chooser option is an option contract that allows the holder to decide whether it is a call or put prior to the expiration date. Chooser options usually have the same strike price and expiration date regardless of what decision the holder makes. Because the option could benefit from upside or downside movement, chooser options provide investors a great deal of flexibility and thus may cost more than comparable vanilla options. Chooser options are typically European style, and have one strike price and one expiration date regardless of whether the option is exercised as a call or put.
https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions/ http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract This ontology covers exotic options, a category of options contracts that differ from traditional options in their payment structures, expiration dates, and strike prices. The underlying asset or security can vary with exotic options allowing for more investment alternatives. Exotic options are hybrid securities that are often customizable to the needs of the investor, and most are traded over the counter (OTC).

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions/KnockInOption http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#example Assume an investor purchases a knock-in put option with a down Direction, with a barrier price of $90 and a strike price of $100. The underlying security is trading at $110, and the option expires in three months. If the price of the underlying security reaches $90, the option comes into existence and becomes a vanilla option with a strike price of $100. Thereafter, the holder of the option has the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price of $100, even though it is trading below $90. It is this right that gives the option value. The put option remains active until the expiration date, even if the underlying security rebounds back above $90. However, if the underlying asset does not fall below the barrier price during the life of the contract, the down-and-in option expires worthless. Just because the barrier is reached does not assure a profit on the trade since the underlying would need to stay below $100 (after triggering the barrier) in order for the option to have value.

The stock price after 30, 60, and 90 days was $21.00, $22.00, and $24.00. The arithmetic average (mean) is (21.00 + 22.00 + 24.00) / 3 = 22.33. The profit is the average minus the strike price 22.33 - 22 = 0.33 or $33.00 per 100 share contract. As with standard options, if the average price is below the strike price, the loss is limited to the premium paid for the call options.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions/ChooserOption http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#example For example, assume a trader wants to have an option position for the updated XYZ Inc. earnings release. They think the stock will have a big move, but they are not sure in which direction. The earnings release is in one month, so the trader decides to buy a chooser option that will expire about three weeks after the earnings release. They believe this should provide enough time for the stock to make a significant move if it is going to make one, and fully digest the earnings release. Therefore, the option they choose will expire in seven to eight weeks. The chooser option allows them to exercise the option as a call if the price of XYZ rises, or as a put if the price falls. At the time of the chooser option purchase, XYZ is trading at $28. The trader chooses an at-the-money strike price of $28 and pays a premium of $2 or $200 for one contract ($2 x 100 shares). The buyer can't exercise the option prior to expiry since it is a European option. At expiry, the trader will determine if they will exercise the option as a call or put. Assume the price of XYZ at the time of expiry is $31. This is higher than the strike price of $28, therefore the trader will exercise the option as a call. Their profit is $1 ($31 - $28 - $2) or $100. If XYZ is trading between $28 and $29.99 the trader will still choose to exercise the option as a call, but they will still be losing money since the profit is not enough to offset their $2 cost. $30 is the breakeven point on the call. If the price of BAC is below $28, the trader will exercise the option as a put. In this case, $26 is the breakeven point ($28 - $2). If the underlying is trading between $28 and $26.01 the trader will lose money since the price didn't fall enough to offset the cost of the option. If the price of BAC falls below $26, say to $24, the trader will make money on the put. Their profit is $2 ($28 - $24 - $2) or $200.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions/DoubleBarrierOption https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Considered an exotic option, a double barrier option is a combination of two single barrier options, with one barrier above and one barrier below the current price of the underlying. It is a bet by the holder that the underlying asset will move significantly, in the case of a knock-in barrier option, or will move by a very small amount, in the case of a knock-out barrier option, over the life of the contract. Traders use these options when they have an opinion on volatility but not on the direction of the underlying asset's next price move. A barrier option is a type of option where the payoff, and the very existence of the option, depends on whether or not the underlying asset reaches a predetermined price.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions/CompoundOption http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#example For example, assume an investor wants to buy a put to sell 100 shares of stock at $50. The stock is currently trading at $55. The investor could buy a Call-Put, which allows them to buy a call now, for say $1 per share ($100), which will allow them to buy a put with a $50 strike in the future. They pay the $1 per share now, but only need to pay the fee for the second option if they exercise the first resulting in them receiving the second option.

Assume the stock trades below $50, at any time, before the call option expires. Therefore, the down-and-out call option promptly ceases to exist.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions/LookbackStrikeTerms https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The payoff may either be the difference between a fixed, pre-agreed Strike Price and the observable, or the difference between the best or worst valuable of the observable and the value of that same observable at maturity of the contract (these are the Fixed and Floating lookback terms respectively). This (per review at Nordea) is not mutually exclusive with the terms for Fixed Strike and Resettable Strike, that is, either of those kinds of strike terms may apply, and Lookback strike terms may also apply.

With this in mind, a better of 2 assets rainbow is essentially a two-asset call option, with a payoff being: Rainbow = max[0, max(S1, S2)] Worse of n Assets Essentially the opposite to the better of n assets, with the payoff being on the asset with the lower value. We can give the payoff for this option on 2 assets as: Rainbow = max[0, min(S1, S2)]
