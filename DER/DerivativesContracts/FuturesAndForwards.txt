https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/FuturesAndForwards/Forward https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Unlike futures contracts (which are processed through a clearing firm), forward contracts are non-standardized. Further, the two parties must bear each other's credit risk, which is not the case with a futures contract. Also, since the contracts are not exchange traded, there is no mark-to-market requirement, which allows a buyer to avoid almost all capital outflow initially (though some counterparties might set collateral requirements). The forward price makes the forward contract have no value when the contract is written. However, if the value of the underlying commodity changes, the value of the forward contract becomes positive or negative, depending on the position held. Forwards are priced in a manner similar to futures. Like in the case of a futures contract, the first step in pricing a forward is to add the spot price to the cost of carry (interest forgone, convenience yield, storage costs and interest/dividend received on the underlying). Unlike a futures contract though, the price may also include a premium for counterparty credit risk, and the fact that there is not daily marking to market process to minimize default risk. If there is no allowance for these credit risks, then the forward price will equal the futures price.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FinancialInstruments/FinancialInstruments/Future https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote A futures contract obligates the buyer to pay the seller a predetermined price based on the market value of the underlier, unless the contract is sold before settlement date which may happen if a trader waits to take a profit or cut a loss. This contrasts with options trading in which the option buyer may choose whether or not to exercise the option. Futures are distinguished from generic forward contracts in that they contain standardized terms, trade on a formal exchange, are regulated by overseeing agencies, and are guaranteed by clearing houses. Also, in order to insure that payment will occur, futures have a margin requirement that must be settled daily. Finally, by making an offsetting trade, taking delivery of goods, or arranging for an exchange of goods, futures contracts can be closed. Hedgers often trade futures for the purpose of keeping price risk in check.
