The difference in this case is not driven by different interest rate periods but from different markets, i.e., the difference in efficiency between the two markets. The objective is to hedge against basis risk which is the difference in price between two markets. See also forward swap, as a means for controlling interest rate.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/Swaps/IndexReturnSwap https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Payments to the parties may be made either on a periodic basis or on termination of the transaction. One party will receive a payment based upon the change in the level of the index between two valuation dates (multiplied by the notional amount of the swap), as modified by the fee paid to the seller of the swap. If the level of the index increases, the buyer of the swap will be entitled to a payment based on this performance, as such payment may be reduced (or negated) by the fee paid to the seller of the swap. If the level of the index decreases, the seller of the swap will be entitled to a payment based on this performance, as such payment may be increased by the fee paid to the seller of the swap.

If the agreed upon notional was US $10,000,000 and the value increased 0.04%, or 4 basis points (bps), the seller would pay the buyer US $4,000. If, after another three months, the value decreased by 3bps, the buyer would pay the seller US $3,000. As part of the agreement, the buyer may also make an additional payment each period to the seller based on a floating rate index multiplied by the notional value.
