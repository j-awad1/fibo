Currency options are one of the best ways for corporations or individuals to hedge against adverse movements in exchange rates. Investors can hedge against foreign currency risk by purchasing a currency option put or call. For example, assume that an investor believes that the USD/EUR rate is going to increase from 0.80 to 0.90 (meaning that it will become more expensive for a European investor to buy U.S dollars). In this case, the investor would want to buy a call option on USD/EUR so that he or she could stand to gain from an increase in the exchange rate (or the USD rise).

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/CurrencyContracts/CurrencySpotContract https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Spot rates represent the price that a buyer expects to pay for a foreign currency in another currency at the time of the quote.
