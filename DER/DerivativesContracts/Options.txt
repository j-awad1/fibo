https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/Options/RiskReversal https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote A risk reversal is a position which simulates profit and loss behavior of owning an underlying security; therefore, it is sometimes called a synthetic long. This is an investment strategy that amounts to both buying and selling out-of-money options simultaneously. In this strategy, the investor will first make a market hunch; if that hunch is bullish, he will want to go long. However, instead of going long on the stock, he will buy an out of the money call option, and simultaneously sell an out of the money put option. Presumably he will use the money from the sale of the put option to purchase the call option. Then as the stock goes up in price, the call option will be worth more, and the put option will be worth less.

Expiration dates on LEAPs can range from nine months to three years, which is longer than the holding period for a traditional call or put option. Although they are not available on all stocks, LEAPS are available on most widely held issues.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/Options/OptionTradingStrategy https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Option trading strategies refer to buying calls or put options or selling calls or put options or both together for the purpose of limiting losses and/or optimizing profits. Basically, these strategies utilize one or more combinations for the best outcome possible based on defined parameters. Simple combinations include option spread trades such as vertical spreads, calendar (or horizontal) spreads, and diagonal spreads. More involved combinations include trades such as condor or butterfly spreads which are actually combinations of two vertical spreads.

Currency baskets are the most popular type of basket option, and they will settle in the holder's home currency. Because it involves just one transaction, a basket option often costs less than multiple single options as it saves on commissions and fees.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/Options/Fence https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The expiration dates of all the options are usually the same. The call strike is normally chosen in such a way that the sum total of the three option premiums is equal to zero. This investment strategy will ensure that the value of the investment at expiry will be between the strike price on the short call and the strike price on the long put. Thus, possible gains and losses (the value of the financial instrument minus the cost of acquiring it) are confined to a specified range. However, if the price of the financial instrument falls below the strike level of the sold put the investor will start participating in any further price declines of the financial instrument.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/Options/ http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract Concepts common to all option contracts. An option gives one party (the holder) the right to purchase or sell the underlying instrument at a given time or times in the future (as determined by the exercise convention), if they choose to do so.
https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/Options/OptionHolder https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote In a call, the option holder has the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset, while, in a put, the option holder has the right to sell the underlying asset. An option holder may sell the option contract itself, at which point the buyer becomes the option holder. Once the instrument is exercised there are typically additional, relevant obligations with regard to settlement.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/Options/Butterfly https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote These spreads are intended as a market-neutral strategy and pay off the most if the underlying asset does not move prior to option expiration. They involve either four calls, four puts, or a combination of puts and calls with three strike prices. Butterfly spreads pay off the most if the underlying asset price doesn't change before the option expires. The upper and lower strike prices are equal distance from the middle, or at-the-money, strike price.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/Options/StripStrategy https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Typically, a strip is a strategy that involves being long in one call position and two put options, all with the same strike price on a single underlying stock. The investor who adopts this strategy believes that the underlying price of the stock will plummet in the near-term future. All three of the options will have the same expiration date and the same strike price. If the investor is correct and the price drastically decreases, the puts will pay out substantially. If the investor is wrong and the price of the underlying asset increases, the call option will mitigate the loss. The period between resets may be called a Caplet or Floorlet.
