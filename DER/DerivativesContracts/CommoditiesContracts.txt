So a commodity swap is like a TRS in that it is based on the return on the increase in value.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/CommoditiesContracts/Bullion https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Physical metals fall into two categories: (1) bullion, which are coins, ingots or bars of a specific weight and purity; and (2) "numismatic" or collectible coins, which can be rare or old coins, or special proofs that are newly minted as collectibles. If a particular asset is identified as "numismatic" or "collectible", it is, by definition, not considered bullion aside from its melt value.
https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/CommoditiesContracts/Bullion http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#example In the United States, bullion that is eligible for reference in a commodities contract may include U.S. gold Buffalo coins minted by the U.S. Mint that are 1 troy ounce, 0.5 ounce, 0.25 ounce, or 0.10 ounce; 1 ounce silver coins; certain platinum coins; and gold, silver, palladium, and platinum bullion that meet or exceed the fineness requirements of a regulated futures contract. Bullion must also be certified by an approved certifier, typically identified by an exchange, including but not limited to the U.S. Mint.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/CommoditiesContracts/CommodityForward https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Commodity forwards are often settled via cash transactions in many industries, including for the purposes of commodity merchandising. Terms may be more "personalized" than is the case with standardized futures contracts (i.e., delivery time and amount are as determined between seller and buyer). A price may be agreed upon in advance, or there may be agreement that the price will be determined at the time of delivery. A forward contract is a private and customizable agreement that settles at the end of the agreement and is traded over-the-counter.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/CommoditiesContracts/WeatherDerivative https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Such a derivative can be used to hedge risks related to the demand for heating fuel or electricity. The underlying 'asset' is not a negotiable commodity per se, but because the weather can impact the prices and other things related to other commodities, weather derivatives are treated as commodity derivatives for regulatory purposes.

Note that the ontology does not include any specific units of measure for these commodities. The intent is that FIBO users would select one of the many available units ontologies to use in specifying the details of individual contracts.
