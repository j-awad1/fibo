https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/RightsAndWarrants/CoveredWarrant https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote In contrast to traditional equity warrants, with covered warrants, no new issuance of common stock occurs if the warrant is exercised. The underlying shares of common stock are usually either owned by the issuer of the covered warrants or the issuer has a mechanism, such as owning equity warrants for the underlying shares, through which they can obtain the shares.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/RightsAndWarrants/CoveredWarrant https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Covered warrants are very similar to options in that they can be created to allow holders to benefit from either rising prices or falling prices, by having both put and call warrants. They can also be created on a wide variety of underlying instruments, not just equities and they are fairly standardised and are mostly traded on exchanges. The main difference is that warrants tend to have longer maturity dates, typically measured in years instead of months (as with options), and are easier to access for individuals as they can be bought and sold in the same way as shares in the stock exchange.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/RightsAndWarrants/MiniFutureCertificate https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The price of a mini-future always corresponds to its intrinsic value, i.e. the capital outlay, plus the bid-ask spread. The financing costs associated with building up the leverage effect are offset against the capital outlay on a daily basis, thereby eliminating the need for a premium. Investors have to pay only financing costs they actually utilize. In contrast to options, factors like volatility have no influence at all on the price of mini-futures.
