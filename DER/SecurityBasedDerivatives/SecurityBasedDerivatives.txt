https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/SecurityBasedDerivatives/SecurityBasedDerivatives/CreditFacilityDebtBasket https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The credit facility debt basket consists of a number of credit facilities including revolving loans/line of credit, committed facilities, letters of credit and most retail credit accounts. The first port of call for issuers is the credit facility debt basket. In addition to the fixed dollar (or euro) amounts, credit facility debt baskets in senior secured notes and indentures typically provide for a grower component that is the greater of the fixed dollar/euro amount and a percentage of total assets, total tangible assets or EBITDA.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/SecurityBasedDerivatives/SecurityBasedDerivatives/RatioDebtBasket https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The ratio basket provides different ratio tests depending on the type of indebtedness being incurred (for example, first lien leverage ratio in respect of first lien indebtedness, senior secured leverage ratio in respect of indebtedness secured by a junior lien and a total net leverage ratio or interest coverage ratio in respect of unsecured indebtedness). A ratio basket would typically allow the borrower to incur debt secured on a senior secured basis subject to a maximum senior secured leverage ratio and unsecured debt subject to a maximum total leverage ratio.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/SecurityBasedDerivatives/SecurityBasedDerivatives/IncrementalFacilityDebtBasket https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The incremental debt basket is available to borrowers and guarantors only; it cannot be used by non-guarantor entities to raise indebtedness. The size of the incremental debt basket varies depending on the size and creditworthiness of the credit group. The principle of a basket consists of allowing the borrower, up to a maximum determined amount, to make restricted payments, disposals or investments, or take on incremental debt. Commonly, a basket is expressed as subject to restrictions based on a fixed ('hard cap') amount (e.g., may not exceed EUR 5,000,000).
