https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/SecurityBasedDerivatives/EquitySwaps/ http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract This ontology defines concepts specific to swap contracts in which one leg gives some form of return on an equity asset, including dividend returns, total asset returns equity dispersion and correlation measurement terms. Many of these return calculations are based on a variety of calculation methods and may vary widely.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/SecurityBasedDerivatives/EquitySwaps/EquityCorrelationSwap https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The underlier for the leg can be any of (1) dividend stream for a single stock, (2) change in value for a single share, (3) change in value for a basket of shares, (4) change in value for an index, (5) value of a dividend stream for a basket of shares, or (6) comparison of the change in value of a given share or basket or index against something else - for example, a single share against an index, which is the thing you are cross-correlating with the volatility of the share.
