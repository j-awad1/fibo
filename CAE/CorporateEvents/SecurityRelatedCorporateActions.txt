https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/CAE/CorporateEvents/SecurityRelatedCorporateActions/InterestPaymentAction http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#editorialNote Further notes: Are there options on the Holder? Yes, you can opt to be paid in a certain currency. It is not always defined in the security terms. So if the Terms in the Security terms sheet gives you an option, there is a choice for the Holder at this point. Such choices would include: - Currency - Pay in Kind ("Spinoff" or PiK - see PiK corporate Action) Could be mandatory. If there were an option then the letter announcing it would require a response. This is usually stated in the message. Is there a message even if there is no option? Yes. Usually have to generate the events artificially as the Servicing organization. you can't rely on a feed or message coming in but because it is part of the security contract the above has to generate at the expected time, and arrange the payments. Q: That is the point at there was a choice you would expect to see a message, or end up still having to generate it but with the choices. A: The ones with Choices come as announcements and don't ave to be generated by the Service. Older definitin (re-scoped now: An Event in which a payment occurs. Anything can have a payment event. If a thing hits a pay date, whether it's voluntary or mandatory, that's a payment event. Divide into: Securities Cash Combination Payment or Distribution? Are these exclusive? Take an event that's always a combination of options, and an option is a combination of payouts. Generates transactions - determine what txns happen when a customer chooses that option. Distribution / delivery: generic concept Payment - implis cash distribution. So payment is specialization of distribution.
