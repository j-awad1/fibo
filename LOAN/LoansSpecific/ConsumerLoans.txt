https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/LOAN/LoansSpecific/ConsumerLoans/MotorVehicleLoan https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Many lenders will only approve auto loans for vehicles (i.e., cars, trucks) that are a certain age (typically 5 years or less) due to depreciation of the value of the vehicle. Because an auto loan is a 'secured' type of loan, the vehicle that is being financed is used as collateral (i.e. if the borrower fails to repay the loan, the vehicle may be seized by the lender).

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/LOAN/LoansSpecific/ConsumerLoans/HomeEquityLineOfCredit https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Home equity loans allow the borrower to borrow against the difference between the fair market value of the property, as determined by an appraisal, and the amount of any outstanding debt on that property, which is typically a first mortgage. Common practice is to set the maximum amount that can be borrowed of up to 80 percent of the fair market value less any outstanding debt.
