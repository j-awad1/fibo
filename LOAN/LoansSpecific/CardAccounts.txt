https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/LOAN/LoansSpecific/CardAccounts/CreditCard https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote In its non-physical form, a credit card represents a payment mechanism which facilitates both consumer and commercial business transactions, including purchases and cash advances. A credit card generally operates as a substitute for cash or a check and most often provides an unsecured revolving line of credit. The borrower is required to pay at least part of the card's outstanding balance each billing cycle, depending on the terms as set forth in the cardholder agreement. As the debt reduces, the available credit increases for accounts in good standing. These complex financial arrangements have ever-shifting terms and prices. A charge card differs from a credit card in that the charge card must be paid in full each month.

The credit company provider may also grant a line of credit (LOC) to the cardholder which allows the holder to borrow money in the form of a cash advance. The issuer pre-sets borrowing limits which have a basis on the individual's credit rating.
