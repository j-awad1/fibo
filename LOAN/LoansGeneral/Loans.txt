In the case of a mortgage, fee simple can be contrasted with lease ownership, in which case the owners have complete access to the land, but they do not own it. Owners of single-family residences typically have fee simple ownership, but condo and many townhouse owners do not, as they own their individual unit but not the land on which the development is built.
