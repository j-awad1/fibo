The registration forms companies file provide essential facts while minimizing the burden and expense of complying with the law. Not all securities must be registered, however. By exempting many small offerings from the registration process, regulators seek to foster capital formation by lowering the cost of offering securities to the public.

The derivative itself is merely a contract between two or more parties. Its value is determined by fluctuations in the underlying asset. Most derivatives are characterized by high leverage.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FinancialInstruments/FinancialInstruments/PackagedFinancialProduct https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Reference assets and market measures may include single equity or debt securities, indexes, commodities, interest rates and/or foreign currencies, as well as baskets of these reference assets or market measures. Like other well-known market instruments such as convertible bonds, many structured products are hybrid securities. Structured products typically have two components - a debt instrument and a derivative, which is often an option. The debt instrument, in some instances, may pay interest at a specified rate and interval. The derivative component establishes payment at maturity, which may give the issuer the right to buy from you, or sell you, the referenced security or securities at a predetermined price. For example, structured products may combine characteristics of debt and equity or of debt and commodities.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FinancialInstruments/FinancialInstruments/Security https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote In the U.S., the Supreme Court has adopted a flexible and liberal approach in determining what constitutes a security. In its famous decision of SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 90 L.Ed. 1244, 66 S.Ct. 1100 (1946), the Court held that land sales contracts for citrus groves in Florida, coupled with warranty deeds for the land and a contract to service the land, were 'investment contracts' and thus securities. The Court stated that [a]n investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. 66 S.Ct. at 1103. According to the Court, it is immaterial whether the shares in the enterprise are evidenced by formal certificates or by nominal interests in the physical assets employed in the enterprise. 66 S.Ct. at 1104.
https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FinancialInstruments/FinancialInstruments/Security https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Whether a contract or other economic right is a security essentially depends on whether the holder of the contract is acting as an investor who seeks financial benefits based on the work of a promoter or a third party.

For example, there is a set expiration date that exchanges will publish for exchange-traded options - in the US it is the Saturday following the third Friday of every month. Similarly, there are set incremental dates for strike for exchange traded options. Contract sizes are also stipulated, for example in the US these are standardized by the OPRA Convention (Options Pricing Reporting Authority).

This amount generally does not change.
		
		For securities the nominal value is often referred to as the face or par value. This is the redemption price of the security and is normally stated on the front of that security. With respect to bonds and stocks, it is the stated value of an issued security, as opposed to its market value.
