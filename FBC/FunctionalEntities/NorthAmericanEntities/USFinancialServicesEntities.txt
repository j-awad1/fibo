A bank acts as a middleman between suppliers of funds and users of funds, substituting its own credit judgement for that of the ultimate suppliers of funds, collecting those funds from three sources: checking accounts, savings and time deposits; short-term borrowings from other banks; and equity capital. A bank earns money by reinvesting these funds in longer-term assets.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FunctionalEntities/NorthAmericanEntities/USFinancialServicesEntities/USBankHoldingCompany https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote According to the FFIEC, a bank holding company is a company that owns and/or controls one or more U.S. banks or one that owns, or has controlling interest in, one or more banks. A bank holding company may also own another bank holding company, which in turn owns or controls a bank; the company at the top of the ownership chain is called the top holder. The Board of Governors is responsible for regulating and supervising bank holding companies, even if the bank owned by the holding company is under the primary supervision of a different federal agency (OCC or FDIC).
