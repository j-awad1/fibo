https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FunctionalEntities/BusinessCenters/ http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract This ontology refines the notion of a business center for reference in defining markets and exchanges, clearing houses, and other functional entities as appropriate. The ontology covers the concept of an FpML business center (excluding those that are business day adjustments), with a focus on a physical place where business is transacted, where relevant.
