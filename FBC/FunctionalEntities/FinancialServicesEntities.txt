To be clearer, non-depository institutions are explicitly disjoint with depository institutions (financial institutions that take deposits of some sort, potentially including securities) in FIBO. Banks are defined as financial institutions that take demand deposits from the public and that also provide commercial lending services. Many 'non-bank' institutions take deposits or provide commercial lending services, but they may not do both.

The trust company oversees the management of assets covered by the trust agreement. Such companies often are used when a grantor feels the trust company can do an equal or better job managing the assets than an individual person, or if the grantor does not know of anyone else who can act as trustee. Trust companies sometimes act as fiscal agents for corporations by attending to the registration and transfer of their stocks and bonds, serving as a trustee for their bond and mortgage creditors, and transacting general banking and loan business.

Non-depository institutions, such as brokerage firms, life insurance companies, pension funds, and investment companies, fund their investment activities directly from financial markets by selling securities to the public or by selling insurance policies, in the case of insurance companies.

These kinds of institutions facilitate alternative financial services, such as investment (both collective and individual), risk pooling, financial consulting, brokering, money transmission, and check cashing. NBFIs are a source of consumer credit (along with licensed banks). Examples of nonbank financial institutions include insurance firms, venture capitalists, currency exchanges, some microloan organizations, and pawn shops. These non-bank financial institutions provide services that are not necessarily suited to banks, serve as competition to banks, and specialize in sectors or groups.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FunctionalEntities/FinancialServicesEntities/CentralCounterpartyClearingHouse https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote These clearing houses are often operated by the major banks in the country. The house's prime responsibility is to provide efficiency and stability to the financial markets that they operate in.

There are two main processes that are carried out by CCPs: clearing and settlement of market transactions. Clearing relates to identifying the obligations of both parties on either side of a transaction. Settlement occurs when the final transfer of securities and funds occur.

CCPs benefit both parties in a transaction because they bear most of the credit risk. If two individuals deal with one another, the buyer bears the credit risk of the seller, and vice versa. When a CCP is used the credit risk that is held against both buyer and seller is coming from the CCP, which in all likelihood is much less than in the previous situation.
