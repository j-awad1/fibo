https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FunctionalEntities/RegulatoryAgencies/ http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract This ontology defines general purpose concepts for representation of regulatory agencies, also known as regulatory authorities or regulators. Examples of financial industry regulatory agencies in the US include the Securities Exchange Commission, FINRA, and the FDIC, among others. The SEC and FINRA are both registration authorities and regulatory agencies. The FDIC is a regulatory agency and an insurer, and may be a registration authority for certain state-chartered banks in the US without bank holding companies.
