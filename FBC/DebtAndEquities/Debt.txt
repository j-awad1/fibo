https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/DebtAndEquities/Debt/DayCountConvention https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Day-count conventions apply to swaps, mortgages and forward rate agreements as well as bonds, each of which has its own day-count convention, which varies depending on the type of instrument, whether the interest rate is fixed or floating, and the country of issuance. Among the most common conventions are 30/360 or 365, actual/360 or 365, and actual/actual. A 30/360 convention assumes 30 days in a month and 360 days in a year. An actual/360 convention assumes the actual number of days in the given month and 360 days in the year. An actual/ actual convention uses the actual number of days in the given interest period and year.
https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/DebtAndEquities/Debt/InterestPaymentTerms https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Note that in most cases, the dates and payment frequencies for interest will coincide with the dates and payment frequencies related to the principal.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/DebtAndEquities/Debt/FloatingInterestRate https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote The index used to determine the specific interest rate is generally included in the terms of the loan. In most cases, lenders will also charge a spread, or added percentage points on top of the established index rate. If a loan is billed as prime plus 2.5 percent, for a prime rate of 3.5 percent, the terms of the loan will require the borrower to pay off a 6 percent interest. Floating interest rates typically involve periodic reset dates for the loan, particularly when the index rate changes. Resets may also occur online at market predetermined intervals, with yearly adjustments being a common arrangement.

Semantic Modeling note This term is over-ridden for specific kinds of debt (securities, loans) and is therefore not needed in any data model. It is included here to define part of the meaning of the Debt Finance term. It is a Relationship Fact and strictly speaking should be regarded as being specialized and over-ridden by the terms in the Loan and Security classes, however it is modeled here as a "Referenceable Archetype" meaning that it appears in diagrams as a textual entry not a relationship line, and so it is not possible to formally show this specialization.
