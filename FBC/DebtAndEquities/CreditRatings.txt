Prime loans have low default risk.
https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/DebtAndEquities/CreditRatings/InvestmentGradeQuality https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote Bond rating firms use different designations, often consisting of the upper- and lower-case letters to identify a bond's credit quality rating. 'AAA' and 'AA' (high credit quality) and 'A' and 'BBB' (medium credit quality) are considered investment grade. Credit ratings for bonds below these designations ('BB,' 'B,' 'CCC,' etc.) are considered low credit quality, and are commonly referred to as 'junk bonds.'
