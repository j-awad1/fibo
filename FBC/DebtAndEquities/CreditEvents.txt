https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/DebtAndEquities/CreditEvents/DefaultEvent https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote A default can occur when a borrower is unable to make timely payments, misses payments, or avoids or stops making payments, typically with respect to a single transaction. A default has adverse effects on the borrower's credit and ability to borrow in the future, and allows the creditor to demand immediate repayment of the obligation in full.

https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/DebtAndEquities/CreditEvents/ http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract This ontology defines a range of credit events, that is events in which some payment or payments are not made. These include credit events relating to a specific debt obligation and events relating to the business entity as a whole. 
		Note: the events defined herein are primarily business rather than consumer oriented, and are specified fairly generally. Many credit events are jurisdiction-specific, such as Chapter 11 restructuring and Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States. This ontology is designed to facilitate jurisdiction and instrument-specific extensions as needed.
